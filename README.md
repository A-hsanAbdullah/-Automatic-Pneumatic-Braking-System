# -Automatic-Pneumatic-Braking-System
This project implements an automatic braking system using an electro-pneumatic valve and a double-acting cylinder controlled by an ultrasonic sensor. When an obstacle is detected within the set threshold, the system automatically applies the brakes, ensuring safety.
ðŸ”§ Components Used:
Electro-Pneumatic Valve (SY5120-5LZ-01)
Double-Acting Cylinder
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Microcontroller (Tiva C Series / Arduino)
12V DC Power Supply
âš¡ Features:
âœ… Automatic braking based on real-time object detection
âœ… Fast response time for safety-critical applications
âœ… Designed for automotive & industrial automation
